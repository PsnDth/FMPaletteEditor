# Palette Setup

Should already include all basecast characters with labelled colour names. Note that the stage will attempt to update projectiles when possible.

Some notes:

1. Octodad airdash reuses his eye white colour when regenerating his clothes. The banana on dash attack is not mapped
2. CV - several attacks are not mapped: 
    a. Forward aerial - laser/visor
    b. Down smash - everything except outline
    c. Up smash - laser/visor
    d. Down special - everything
    e. Neutral special - everything except outline
3. Welltaro
    a. All fire effects/projectiles (incl. bullets) are not mapped
    b. Outlines are not replace-able? Need to double check
    c. Sketch animations have weird mapping (obv)
4. Orcane 
    a. Everything is mapped
5. Fishbunjin
    a. Effects are not mapped (downb/neutralb)
    b. Dumbbell is* mapped but not present in hud image. There is only 1 costume for it so all costumes will use the last updated colour
