Palette Editor
==============
Custom stage that allows modifying in-game palettes (as of v 0.6.1)

This should work on base and custom characters/assists. With additional tooling to ensure base contentn works as expected.

This repository includes the stage code, setup palette files for base cast and setup website code.

To use, build a custom project using https://psndth.github.io/PaletteEditor/. The site also includes instructions for setting things up.
